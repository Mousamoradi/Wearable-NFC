## Wearable-NFC
In this work, we proposed and implemented a real-time android based Near field communication (NFC) reader using android studio to read temperature sensor wirelessly. NFC is a set of standards for smartphones and similar devices to establish radio communication with each other by touching them together or bringing them into proximity, usually no more than a few inches. In this work, for testing our app’s performance, a RF430FRL15xH evaluation kit by Texas instrument (TI) has been used. This device consists of a 13.56-MHz transponder chip with a programmable 16-bit MSP430 low power microcontroller. The RF430FRL15xH supports both active and passive communication modes which in this study we only used battery-less operation (passive-mode). The board consists of three analog sensors as inputs which one of them connected to on-board temperature sensor. The model of micro controller unit (MCU) used in this radiofrequency identification (RFID) board is FR430 which it has a 14-bit sigma delta analog to digital converter. This app can show voltage resolution as lower as 22.88 µV when signal processing in sensor has been done. The results of temperature reading will be stored as a text format in internal memory of the android device and can be shared for further analysis.
