## Wearable-NFC
In this study, we designed and implemented a real-time Android-based near-field communication (NFC) reader using Android Studio to wirelessly read temperature sensors. NFC is a communication protocol that allows smartphones and similar devices to exchange data when brought into close proximity, typically within a few inches (ECMA International, 2013). To evaluate the app’s performance, we utilized the RF430FRL15xH evaluation kit from Texas Instruments (TI), which features a 13.56 MHz transponder chip integrated with a programmable 16-bit MSP430 low-power microcontroller (Texas Instruments, 2015). The RF430FRL15xH supports both active and passive communication modes; however, in this study, we exclusively operated it in battery-less passive mode (Schreiner et al., 2018). The board includes three analog sensor inputs, one of which is connected to an onboard temperature sensor (TI Datasheet, 2015). The microcontroller unit (MCU) used in this RFID board is the FR430, equipped with a 14-bit sigma-delta analog-to-digital converter (Smith et al., 2016). Our app is capable of displaying voltage resolutions as low as 22.88 µV when sensor signal processing is performed (TI Application Report, 2017). The recorded temperature readings are stored as text files in the Android device’s internal memory and can be shared for further analysis.
